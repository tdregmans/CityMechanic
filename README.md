## The idea
> Idea for a new game:
> 
> I have a new idea for a new game: It is a simulation game. You controle a civilisation. There are things that can control and things you cannot control.
> 
> Every month, a new civilisation start. There are different types of civilisations, like:
> - Egyptians
> - Arabians
> - Romans
> - Scots
> - Americans
> - Nazis
> - Communists
> - Russians
> - Greeks
> - Trans-humanists
> 
> In the game, 24 hours equals 1 year.
> 
> Certain events can happen to the civilisation:
> - Economic recession/stagnation/growth
> - New tech introduced
> - Revolution
> - Pandemic
> 
> There are a number of options you have:
> - Install world leaders
> - Introduce new tech
> - Create more nature
> - Be hard/soft on crime
> - Impose religion 
> 
> There are a few scales on which we measure how alive your civilication is:
> - Economic (GDP/head, trades/head)
> - Happiness (Suicides, average of other factors)
> - Social Cohesion 
> - Health (average healthy years)

## Architecture
I am building the game in a html/javascript frame. You play the game in your browser. I don't know yet if there will be a database.
If I need to save data, I can also store cookies. If I need to get data, I can have a csv or json-file for the game contants.
I'm not yet sure how this will be.
